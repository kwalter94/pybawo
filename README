* Running PyBawo
-------------------
Run main.py to start game. Networked game play is yet to be implemented.
The game requires a working Python 2 installation with Tkinter and Python
Imaging Library (PIL).

To run on Debian or Ubuntu GNU/Linux systems, you must install the following
packages using apt or whatever package manager you use:
	* python
	* python-tk
	* python-imaging
	* python-imaging-tk

To run on Windows get Python 2.7 from http://www.python.org and PIL from
http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/ or instead you can get Pillow which
is a PIL fork from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow. Make sure you get
a PIL or Pillow that matches your Python version, that is if you are using
Python 2.7 get a PIL for Python 2.7. NOTE: I have not tried the game on
Windows, if you experience any problems in running the game, please inform me
at walterkaunda@gmail.com.

* How to play Bawo/Bao
----------------------
You can find the rules of how to play bawo at
http://www.gamecabinet.com/rules/bao.html. The page at gamecabinet has rules
on how to play the beginner (yawana) and advanced (yabambo) variants of Bawo.
The ntchuwa variant available in the game is similar to the advanced version
with no nyumba. NOTE: PyBawo does not yet implement the Takasia rule.

PyBawo adds some few rules of its own to make computer play easy (possible).
1) Takata moves that exceed the long_move_limit (defaults at 200) in terms of
   number of sows (steps) are deemed infinite and illegal. Never ending moves
   have been proven to exist and are all takata moves (see "Towards a
   Quasi-Endgame-Based Bao Solver" by Tom Kronenburg, and
   "Never Ending Moves in Bao" by Tom Kronenburg, Jeroen Donkers,
   and Alex J. de Voogt)
2) In Namua, a capture move that ends on the nyumba ends there. There is no
   option to continue or not continue the move as part of the same move.
   The player is simply requested to make another move in which the player
   may sow the nyumba or leave it by making a null move (see below for how
   this is done).
   
* Perfoming moves in PyBawo
--------------------------
To perform a normal move, left click on the hole where the move must start 
then click on the hole to the left or right depending on which direction you
want the move to go. NOTE: you do not have to click on the store when in Namua,
the nkhomo is introduced into the game automatically after you select your
move.

To perform a null move, left click twice on your nyumba.

To cancel a move, right click after selecting (by left clicking) the hole where
you want the move to start. You can only cancel a move before the second right
click. A move in execution can not be cancelled but it can be undone after its
finished execution.
